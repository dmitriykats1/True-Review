# True Review - A personalized Yelp Restaurant Recommender

Yelp has been around since 2004, helping people find great local businesses by presenting an easy to read star rating along with more detailed usersâ€™ reviews. By the beginning of 2019, the number of users and reviews has exploded to over 100M and 184M, respectively. We are going to look at a small subset of the data in order to draw insights in review trends and restaurant trends and use these insights to guide users to a better experience by predicting their personal rating of a specific restaurant.
